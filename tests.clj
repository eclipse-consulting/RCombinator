;; Writing rigorous unit tests for concurrency bugs in Clojure, particularly 
;; for a system using STM (Software Transactional Memory) and core.async, 
;; requires us to focus on ensuring that:
;;
;; - Shared state is updated correctly without race conditions.
;; - Multiple tasks interacting with shared state donâ€™t interfere with each other.
;; - Atomicity of updates is guaranteed by STM.

;; In Clojure, concurrency bugs are hard to detect through unit tests alone because 
;; the errors may only appear under certain timing or execution conditions. However, 
;; we can use tests to simulate concurrent task execution and verify that the 
;; shared state (counter in our case) is updated as expected.
